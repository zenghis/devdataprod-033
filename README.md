# Shiny App
<ul>
<li>The Shiny app is a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
<li>After two numbers are inserted, the results would be automatically calculated.</li>
<li>The display of the results could be slighty delayed, possibly due to heavy loads on the server.</li>
</ul>
